**#Abstract**

Advancements in artificial intelligence in the cybersecurity domain introduce significant security challenges. A critical concern is the exposure of deep learning techniques to adversarial attacks. Adversary users intentionally attempt to mislead the techniques by infiltrating adversarial samples during the training or testing phase to mislead the prediction of security devices. The study presents extensive experimentation of defense methods using Python-based open-source code with two benchmark datasets, and the outcomes are demonstrated using evaluation metrics. This code library can be easily utilized and reproduced for cybersecurity research on countering adversarial attacks. Exploring strategies for defending against adversarial attacks is significant in enhancing the resilience of deep learning techniques.

**#Research Questions**

•	How can LSTM architecture layer optimization be performed, and can RNN be used as a source of LSTM layers, a useful classifier, and improve the attack detection rate? 

•	How can DeepFool and Limited-memory BFGS be employed to develop adversarial attacks?

•	What is the importance of transfer learning in adversarial attacks? 

•	What techniques can be used to enhance the ability of DL models to identify adversarial attacks by combining hybrid defense techniques?
